	"content": " Source code Example Pure Browser Application using Lightstreams\nIntroduction This example decentralized application (DApp) demonstrates how two or more peers can connect together and securely share private content together without the need for a central server. You can point the application to your local Lightstreams Node (localhost:9000). By default it connects to our public gateway on the sirius testnet, https://gateway.sirius.lightstreams.io.\nBrowser Appplication The example is only made of static js/css/html and uses react, redux, and styled-components under the hood. The files that you upload are stored on the Lightstreams Node and the files\u0026rsquo; metadata are stored on browser\u0026rsquo;s localStorage. If you delete your localStorage, you will no longer see what files have been uploaded to your node.\njs-ipfs In order to discover other peers with whom to share content, the example application uses the the js-ipfs implementation of IPFS for peer-discovery. This is a bit overkill for now, but could allow for information or file-exchange before the actual sharing of private content.\nGetting started  Follow the steps in the README to install \u0026amp; run the application (the application should be running on http://localhost:8080 (we\u0026rsquo;ll call this running app, node1) Create an account with a password. This will generate a public key that you should write down somewhere, it can be used to login (with your password) and unlock your wallet on the Lightstreams Node. Request Lightstreams free test tokens to the newly created address (https://discuss.lightstreams.network/t/request-test-tokens/64) Upload some content Copy the File Meta Hash (under the \u0026ldquo;Files\u0026rdquo; sections) Paste the File Meta Hash in the \u0026ldquo;Download File\u0026rdquo; section Click on the Link to download the file  Grant access to/share content with another peer Once you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded some content, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably want to grant access to someone else and share it with them.\n In a new browser (if you use Chrome, launch Firefox or Safari), we\u0026rsquo;ll launch another app (which we\u0026rsquo;ll call node2). Open the same URL: http://localhost:8080 Create an account with password In node1, go to your uploaded files and copy paste the account address from node2 into the input next to the \u0026ldquo;Grant to\u0026rdquo; button In node2, copy the File Meta Hash into the \u0026ldquo;Download File\u0026rdquo; section Click on the link to download the file. Tada! You are allowed to download the file. Try again, upload a file on node1, but this time skip Step3 (don\u0026rsquo;t grant access to node2). You should not be able to download the file!  Conclusion This Lightstreams browser application shows how two or more peers can securely share private content between one another without the need for a central server and using blockchain smart contracts to grant access/permissions to the files.\n"

	"content": " Source code Code\nIntroduction Lightstreams Smart Vault Dashboard app showcase an example of a decentralize app (Dapp) using Lightstreams Smart Vault SDK in a NodeJS.\nUsing this DApp you will be able to upload your files uploaded into a Lightstreams Smart Vault node and manage the its distribution and acceptability. In addition you will be able to also request access to other users files and manage the pending request to your own content made by other users.\nFeatures Create an account Login Your user wallet Upload file My files You can see the list of files you uploaded and which users have access to them. By clicking on one of the little icon you can revoke the access to the users at anytime.\nAlso you can download the content of the files you uploaded.\nGrant access to file Grant access to other users to your content without waiting for a access request.\nRequest access to other user file Insert the username of other user and load the list of available items of this user. By clicking on the locker icon you will send a access request to the file owner. In case you already got access to the file it will display the download action.\nManage pending access requests On this section it will listed the pending access requests from other users to your files.\nFreemium Model This project implements a simple freemium model to fund users activity within the platform. The source for this funding come from two different sources.\nThe first of them is what it was called stake holder account. This account is linked to every instance of the server application and it is funding the creation of new users through its own endpoints.\nThe second funding source is an Faucet smart contract 0xdf81615E44b34C7015bF148De30526A4863c0DcD which will fund the activity of users up to 10 PHTs. This smart contract can be top up by every entity interested in the growth of the project.\nOnce users exceeds the initial 10 PHTs they can request more tokens for their accounts contacting Lightstreams Dev Team either Telegram or on the Discuss forum\n"

	"content": " In this section, we will explain the steps to install and synchronize a Lightstreams PoA blockchain node. Moreover, as part of the functionalities required by token exchanges, we will be proving examples of how to interact with Lightstreams blockchain in order to create accounts, transfer tokens or fetch tx receipts.\nInstallation Lightstreams has released its own ethereum-compatible blockchain which uses Byzantine consensus to replace the original proof-of-work (PoW) from Ethereum.\nUsing lightchain you can connect to Lightstreams blockchain and use every functionality currently existing on Ethereum. See more in the command line documentation\nPre-compiled binaries Lightstreams provides precompiled binaries for the most popular Unix distributions: and macOS.\n== macOS ==\nwget \u0026quot;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/lightstreams-public/lightchain/latest/lightchain-osx\u0026quot; -O /usr/local/bin/lightchain  == Linux (amd64) ==\nwget \u0026quot;https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/lightstreams-public/lightchain/latest/lightchain-linux-amd64\u0026quot; -O /usr/local/bin/lightchain  After downloading the binary, you will need to set the right executable permissions to it, as follow:\nchmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lightchain  From Source code In case you prefer to compile your own version of lightchain you just need to follow the instructions at this repository.\nRun Lightstreams node Once lightchain is installed we can proceed with the initialization and synchronization of a new lightstreams node.\nLightstreams implements two networks: mainnet and a testnet called sirius. At the minute lightchain is connecting by default to mainnet as our team is still working on the launch of the mainnet.\nNode initialization To initialise a new blockchain you need to run lightchain init and choose a local path where blockchain files are going to be stored.\nlightchain init --datadir=\u0026quot;${HOME}/.lightstreams-mainnet\u0026quot; --mainnet  Node launching To run a lightchain node you only need to run the following command:\nlightchain run --datadir=\u0026quot;${HOME}/.lightstreams-mainnet\u0026quot;  After the command is executed the Lightstreams node will proceed with the synchronization. Once the node is synchronized we should leave node running in order to interact with the blockchain.\nLightstreams also provides a block explorer to see which is the current state of the blockchain.\nHelp To see more available options for launching a lightchain node, check the client documentation section or execute in the terminal:\nlightchain run -h  Interact with Lightstreams node As it was mentioned above, Lightstreams node is fully ethereum-compatible therefore ethereum JSON RPC API is also available.\nTo enable those RPC endpoints, we need to specify the APIs we want to enable and the endpoints. At the command line argument, when Lightstreams node is launched, we need to include --rpc --rpcapi eth,net,web3,personal,admin. In case you want to enable the WebSocket endpoints you have to also use--ws\nlightchain run --datadir=\u0026quot;${HOME}/.lightstreams-mainnet\u0026quot; --rpc --rpcapi eth,net,web3,personal,admin --ws  By default RPC API is exposed over port :8545 and WebSocket over port :8546. In case you want to specify a different port, you may use the following flags --rpcport ${RPC_PORT} or --wsport ${WS_PORT} respectively.\nIn addition to those, IPC Unix socket is always enabled and you can find it at ${HOME}/.lightstreams-mainnet/database/geth.ipc (according to the values used on above example)\nExample As it is explained above we can interact with Lightstreams node as we would have been interacting with an Ethereum node. For instance, we could attach a Geth to the running Lightstreams node and create a new account and perform a transfer.\nStart interactive Geth console\ngeth attach http://localhost:8545  Create a new account\n\u0026gt; personal.newAccount(\u0026quot;passphrase\u0026quot;) \u0026quot;0xe7094bd66363c0442bd99ea00fccb19b0d272453\u0026quot;  Transfer tokens\n\u0026gt; eth.sendTransaction({from:eth.accounts[0], to:\u0026quot;0xe7094bd66363c0442bd99ea00fccb19b0d272453\u0026quot;, value: web3.toWei(0.05, \u0026quot;ether\u0026quot;)}) \u0026quot;0x2ca8bce6a70566a0869a9fd2ac74743e05fe19e17ec118d7a4933f07714faeed\u0026quot;  Read receipt\n\u0026gt; eth.getTransactionReceipt(\u0026quot;0x2ca8bce6a70566a0869a9fd2ac74743e05fe19e17ec118d7a4933f07714faeed\u0026quot;) { blockHash: \u0026quot;0xc96707c294c79b7d3667a59e5f097f72375d4b7f0135e0055eabc5e70ddec717\u0026quot;, blockNumber: 17793, contractAddress: null, cumulativeGasUsed: 21000, from: \u0026quot;0xc916cfe5c83dd4fc3c3b0bf2ec2d4e401782875e\u0026quot;, gasUsed: 21000, logs: [], logsBloom: \u0026quot;0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\u0026quot;, status: \u0026quot;0x1\u0026quot;, to: \u0026quot;0xe7094bd66363c0442bd99ea00fccb19b0d272453\u0026quot;, transactionHash: \u0026quot;0x2ca8bce6a70566a0869a9fd2ac74743e05fe19e17ec118d7a4933f07714faeed\u0026quot;, transactionIndex: 0 }  "

Lightstreams document authorizer demo intends to show case a real world document authorizer application where content creators could offer their intellectual property for selling in a decentralized manner using Lightstreams Smart Vault to guarantee the security and traceability of their published content.\nNodes Lightstreams provides two separate and independent nodes of this document authorizer demo to represent the real decentralization of this DApp.\n Demo Node 1 Demo Node 2  Application On every new session an user is automatically created and credited with 2 PHT. Below you can find a short explanation of the functionalities you can find in this demo.\nLightstreams WhitePaper On the Demo home page default there is pre-uploaded content to purchase, in this case it is the Lightstreams WhitePaper for the reasonable price of 0.2 PHT.\nUpload Content From home page click, or from the application service, on Publish or from the application menu.\nAfter you agree on the term\u0026amp;conditions it will start deploying a new Smart Contract which will hold the Access Control List(ACL) of the file you are about to upload. It is required to have at least 1 PHT to perform this action.\nOnce the deployment of the smart contract is completed, you fill up the form include a title and description for the new file, a cover image and the file itself. Click on Publish. After uploading and deployment is finished it will display a content profile card with the public and private information of the published content.\nLibrary On the Library every purchased and published content is being listed.\nShare your Content To purchase the content published by other users we need to Search for it using the Public Content ID provided after uploading was completed. Pasting that ID and click on Search the public data regarding the published content is displayed along with a Purchase button to proceed with the purchasing of the content.\nPurchase Content To purchase this content you need to click on the public link, this link loads the public metadata information about the content such as Title, Description, Cover image, Owner and price. After you click in Purchase it performs a purchase tx in the blockchain which send to the content owner to total amount set at the price.\nOnce the tx is completed the private content is loaded and downloadable. Also you can see the receipt of it and clicking on it you can see from Lightstreams Explorer the actual details of the transaction.\n"

So grab a coffee and request some test tokens while you wait :)\nTo see the current state of the lightstreams test network (Sirius) and check the status of your transactions, you can go to the lightstreams block explorer\nUsing Rinkeby network If you prefer to run your leth over the Rinkeby network, just repeat the commands a using --network=rinkeby.\nExpose the Lighstreams HTTP API You need to run your leth server again, but this time using the --https flag as follow:\nleth run --nodeid=1 --network=sirius --https Even if flag used refers to https by default is exposed over http. In case you want to use a secure protocol, follow the instructions in the next section.\nRunning over HTTPs To initialize leth over HTTPs protocol you need to follow the next steps. At first you need to use valid SSL certificates which can be generated, for instance, by running the following bash command:\nmkdir -p /etc/ssl/leth cd /etc/ssl/leth openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key \\  -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 \\  -subj \u0026#39;/CN=localhost\u0026#39; -extensions EXT -config \u0026lt;( \\  printf \u0026#34;[dn]\\nCN=localhost\\n[req]\\ndistinguished_name = dn\\n[EXT]\\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\u0026#34;) chmod a+r localhost.crt localhost.key Once you have valid ssl certificates are allocated in your local machine, you have to edit leth node configuration file, at $HOME/.lightstreams_1/config.json, and include the path for your ssl certificates and the port where the HTTPs server is going to be exposed.\n{ \u0026#34;https_server\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: 8080, \u0026#34;certificate_pem_filepath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/etc/ssl/leth/localhost.crt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;certificate_pem_priv_key_filepath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/etc/ssl/leth/localhost.key\u0026#34; }, ....

	"content": " Introduction This example decentralized application (DApp) demonstrates how two or more peers can connect and securely sell/purchase commercial content together without the need for a central server.\nSource code Example Decentralized Peer-to-Peer eCommerce app written using ReactJS + Leth SDK\nApp The example is only made of static js/css/html and uses ReactJS framework.\nhttps://example-eshop.lightstreams.io\n1) Configuring Node Provider The first step is to configure a fully synced Lightstreams Node responsible for storing files in SmartVault, managing accounts and performing the blockchain Calls/TXs.\nWe encourage you to run your own local node. By default, the app connects to our public gateway on the Sirius Testnet.\n2) Configure Your Account Create your Lightstreams account or login using an existing one. The password will be used to encrypt, lock the keystore file on the node\u0026rsquo;s disk.\n3) Create a Shop After you configure your account, you enter a general dashboard where you can see all the eShops created by our community, the content being sold and how to buy it.\nFor simplicity of the demo, the metadata such as smart contract addresses of all the shops created by Lightstreams community are stored and aggregated in a real-time Firebase DB but when developing your own application, you can store them however you find appropriate. Smart contract? MySQL Database? IPFS?\nFor creating an eShop, you will need some PHT tokens. Request them at our forum.\nCreating a shop using the UI will create and deploy a new smart contract keeping track of the digital content you will be selling. This is possible thanks to the Leth SDK shop module booted on Lightstreams Node launch and exposed over CLI and HTTPS. For full documentation about the internals, visit our getting started with e-commerce guide.\n4) Sell/Buy Content Content on sale is stored in the configured node\u0026rsquo;s SmartVault.\nE.g, you can purchase a picture of a fountain I took in Mallorca for 15 Sirius test network PHTs. Behind the scenes, the SmartVault will grant you a permission to access this picture, securely stored in Lightstreams enhanced permissioned IPFS, the moment the Shop\u0026rsquo;s Smart Contract receives the funds.\nConclusion Thanks to Lightstreams SDK, Leth, creating DApps and monetizing commercial content was never easier!\nGetting started with e-commerce guide.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " What is Lightstreams? Lightstreams brings the capability of storing assets (files) in conjunction with Blockchain technology in a efficient, low-priced and decentralized manner. The key innovation is an advanced permissioning system that lets content producers store and monetise their intellectual property (text, images, music, movies).\nA new generation of internet applications (known as Decentralised Applications or DApps) can also be developed using this technology. Lightstreams lets DApp developers store and manage access to files needed for their DApps that cannot be privately or cheaply be stored with other blockchains.\nLightstreams is a public blockchain. This means that is 100% open for anyone to connect without restrictions. However, unlike most public blockchains, files on Lightstreams are stored securely and privately and only distributed with permission on a peer-to-peer basis. Each content producer or DApp developer is able to share protected content quickly with granular control and access tracking. This ensures transparency and auditability of when, how, and by whom data was approved and transmitted between users. DApp developers developing smart contracts on blockchain (including but not limited to Ethereum’s public blockchain) can seamlessly reference files stored on the Lightstreams network.\nWhy build on Lightstreams?  Real-world identities Use people’s verified identity to build real-world applications. Distributed Secure Storage Network Distributed secure storage is made available to applications to permit access to content in a decentralised environment. Fast. Scalable Get all the benefits from a decentralized infrastructure for distributing content without blockchain scaling issues. Trustless Build decentralized marketplaces with peer-to-peer exchanges.  Why use DApps built on Lightstreams?  Self-sovereign identity Users control their identity. They decide who can see and use it. Users control \u0026amp; manage their own data. Applications always need to request permissions to use it. No single point of failure for data breaches that can occur in traditional highly centralised internet services. Monetise content Higher royalty earnings by digital content and intellectual property direct sales. Users earn income for curating discoverable content. Users can hold in tokens associated with content to benefit from appreciation in value. Decentralised network Participation in a network that is not controlled by any one entity. Self-governance for an open, fair and stable network Each user\u0026rsquo;s vote determines the direction of the network.  Who needs Lighststreams?  DApps that require high security for managing access to information. Data is protected through ensuring only the correct people (or businesses) can see the information (eg only your doctors or lawyer). Distributed sharing of data with authorised people eliminates any centralised point of weakness that can be breached.\n Consumers who want to control their data privacy by allowing them to be (monetarily) rewarded for sharing select information only to the companies they trust (and no one else)\n Those selling digital content (eg music/audio) with rights of ownership (and royalties for artists) automatically included.\n Business that require confidential legal documents to be digitally signed directly between parties without requiring an intermediary to facilitate execution.\n  How does it work? Lightstreams uses its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain for the transparent and auditable management of file-access permissions, and a separate enhanced IPFS protocol for encrypted file storage and peer-to-peer file distribution. The Lightstreams blockchain is based on Ethereum but modified for shorter block times and also replaces the wasteful proof-of-work protocol with proof-of-authority.\nWhat does this enable? Lightstreams allows content producers to monetise their intellectual property. Content producers will be able to share files, images, music and movies and monetise them directly without needing a third party to host the content or broker the details - the smart contracts on the Lightstreams blockchain manage the payments and permissioning.\nDApps that use Lightstreams will allow users to access content such as audio, video or images in a fast and responsive manner - currently not possible on Ethereum’s public blockchain. We imagine two scenarios, one being DApps built on Ethereum referencing files on Lightstreams, and the other being DApps built directly on Lightstreams. As Lightstreams’ blockchain is compatible with Ethereum, moving a DApp from Ethereum to Lightstreams is simple.\nWhat is an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)? The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol can be described as a standard to create a content-addressable peer-to-peer method of storing and retrieving data in a distributed file system. The content-addressing system guarantees that the data retrieved always matches the address used for finding the data. It is decentralised, meaning there is no dependency on any one computer or entity for hosting the data. Data is be replicated to multiple computers as it is shared, this add many layers of redundancy. In other words, every computer hosting a specific piece of data would need to be compromised to lose the data.\nThe hypermedia protocol also scales on demand - the more demand there is for a file, the more copies are made and so the faster the data transfer of that file becomes by virtue of the increased number of computers sharing files/content/data at the same time.\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum is a public, open-source blockchain-based computing platform. Its main feature is that of a Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for running modules of application code called smart contracts. A user may think of Ethereum as an operating system for running apps (like a smartphone that can run multiple apps). Ethereum is decentralised. The system or network is not run by one specific entity that owns the infrastructure.\nSmart Contracts are used to enact business logic, essential for DApps on the Ethereum network. A smart contract is suitable for small data, they are not suitable for the storage and retrieval of media files.\n"
