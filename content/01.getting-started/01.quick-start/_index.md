## Introduction

A Lightstreams node consists of the following pieces:

- `leth` is a command line interface used to run, interact, and control the Lightstreams node
- `ipfs` is a decentralised file system enhanced with our award winning “Permissioned Blocks” technology
- `geth` is the the command line interface for running a full ethereum node implemented in Go

In the next section, we will proceed to install everything required to run a complete Lightstreams node.
