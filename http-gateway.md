# Introduction

In order to facilitate the onboarding of new developers to our
[lightstreams node](/getting-started-with-lightstreams-node) we provide an open
**API Gateway** to interact with it via HTTPs protocol. The vast majority
of the functionalities implemented on lightstreams node is available
using our api.

The **API Gateway** aims to provide an additional layer of abstraction on the
[lightstreams node](/getting-started-with-lightstreams-node) to simplify
Ethereum Blockchain and IPFS protocol functionalities such as upload
new file to lightstreams IPFS network and create ethereum accounts and transfer
funds among them.

Every transaction executed runs over `rinkeby` network and IPFS content
is stored, only provisionally, within lightstreams private network,
therefore content is only accessible using the provided API.

Leth Gateway is running on the following domain
```
https://gateway.lightstreams.network:9091
```

## How to use it

### Create an account
Example of CURL request to create a new account:
```
curl -X POST https://gateway.lightstreams.network:9091/user/signup \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"password":"password"}'
```

Visit the following [link](/http-api-doc) to learn how about every
available entrypoint.
